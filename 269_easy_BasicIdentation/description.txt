You'll be given a number N, representing the number of lines of BASIC code. Following that will be a line containing the text to use for indentation, which will be ···· for the purposes of visibility. Finally, there will be N lines of pseudocode mixing indentation types (space and tab, represented by · and » for visibility) that need to be reindented.
Blocks are denoted by IF and ENDIF, as well as FOR and NEXT.
